LIDAR Filter
========

LIDAR Filter will provide you with useful functions to reduce noise in the data coming from a LIDAR sensor
attached to your robot. LIDAR filter provides two filters entitled as range and temporal median.

To use this software:

    To use range filter, you should define an list of sensor measurements.
    Example:
    
    // Range filter
    minimum, maximum = 0.03, 5 
    sensorMeasurementsRangeFilter = [[0., 1., 2., 1., 3.], [1., 5., 7., 1., 3.], [2., 3., 4., 1., 0.], [3., 3., 3., 1., 3.], [10., 2., 4., 0., 0.]]
    sensorMeasurementsRangeFilterOutput = rangeFilter(sensorMeasurements, minimum, maximum)

    rangeFilter has the algorithm for scanning and updating the sensor data i.e filtering the data based on range values.

    To use temporal median filter, you should define an list of sensor measurements and perform range filtering and define d previous scans.
    Example:
    d  = 4

    temporalMedianFilterOp = list(tempMedianFilter(sensorMeasurementsRangeFilterOutput, d+1))
	

Tests
--------
Testing includes:
	-- Empty scan
	-- Problem sample 
	-- Scans with very large values up to 1e30
	-- Large number of measurements up to 1000
	-- Large number of scans (1000) with large number of measurements (1000)
	-- Update with 20 number of random scans each with 10 measurements


	
Testing Platform setup
-----------------------
   To run all testcases, simply run lidarFilters.py and testlidarFilters.py located inside the same directory.
